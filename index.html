                    <span class="highlighted">Virat Kohli is one of the most accomplished cricketers in the history of the sport.</span> Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli made his debut for the Indian national team in 2008 and quickly established himself as a key player. Renowned for his aggressive batting style, Kohli has broken numerous records, including the fastest century in One Day Internationals (ODIs) by an Indian. His ability to chase down challenging targets has earned him the nickname "Chase Master."
                    <br><br>
                    Kohli's leadership skills were on display when he captained the Indian team to several significant victories, including the 2018 Test series win in Australia, which was India's first-ever on Australian soil. His passion, consistency, and dedication have made him a global icon, and he is often regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of his generation. Off the field, Kohli is known for his fitness regimen, philanthropic activities, and entrepreneurial ventures, including his clothing line, Wrogn. His journey from a young cricketer to a global superstar is a testament to his relentless work ethic and commitment to the game.
